\f0\fs24 \cf0 The Variable array holds the variables, they are stored as x, y pairs that correspond to the location of the square on the sudoku board, they range from (0,0) to (8,8).\
\
The Domain array holds the domain for each variable, the domain at position i corresponds with the variable at position i in the variable array.\
\
The Constraint array holds pairs of variables, each variable is stored as it\'92s index in the variable array. Every constraint is such that the variable on the left cannot equal the variable on the right.\
\
Flattening the alldiff constraints into binary constraints and removing duplicates resulted in 1,620 total constraints.}
